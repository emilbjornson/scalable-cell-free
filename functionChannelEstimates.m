%UEs in the entire network. The channels are assumed to be correlated
%Rayleigh fading and the MMSE estimator is used.

%INPUT:
%R                 = Matrix with dimension N x N x L x K where (:,:,l,k) is
%                    the spatial correlation matrix between AP l and UE k 
%                    in setup n, normalized by noise
%nbrOfRealizations = Number of channel realizations
%L                 = Number of APs
%K                 = Number of UEs per cell
%N                 = Number of antennas per AP
%tau_p             = Number of orthogonal pilots
%pilotIndex        = Vector containing the pilot assigned to each UE
%p                 = Uplink transmit power per UE (same for everyone)
%
%OUTPUT:
%Hhat         = Matrix with dimension L*N x nbrOfRealizations x K where
%               (:,n,k) is the estimated collective channel to UE k in
%               channel realization n.
%H            = Matrix with dimension L*N x nbrOfRealizations x K with the
%               true channel realizations. The matrix is organized in the
%               same way as Hhat_MMSE.
%B            = Matrix with dimension N x N x L x K where (:,:,l,j) is the
%               spatial correlation matrix of the estimate between AP l and
%               UE k in setup n, normalized by noise
%C            = Matrix with dimension N x N x L x K where (:,:,l,j) is the
%               spatial correlation matrix of the channel estimation error
%               between AP l and UE k in setup n, normalized by noise
